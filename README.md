Instructions:

To run the SingleStore notebook, download it from this repository and then open it in SingleStore Notebooks (otherwise, it is not guaranteed that dependencies will be installed properly without additional manual installation).

Make sure to run the cells in order (it takes some time). The last code cell creates slider widgets that feed user input into the final model.

Sources:

[Red Wine Quality Dataset (required)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)
- added associated [White Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality) from the same original paper

Besides documentations of the libraries used, all other technical information used is linked at the bottom of the notebook.
